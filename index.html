                    In this layout, we display the areas in source order for any screen less that 500 pixels wide. We go to a two column
                layout, and then to a three column layout by redefining the grid, and the placement of items on the grid.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are some key differences with how a grid layout works over the grid systems you may have used previously. As you
                can see, we do not need to add any markup to create a row, grid systems need to do this to stop elements popping up into
                the row above. With CSS Grid Layout, we can place things into rows, with no danger of them rising up into the row above
                if it is left empty. Due to this strict column and row placement we can also easily leave white space in our layout. We
                also donâ€™t need special classes to pull or push things, to indent them into the grid. All we need to do is specify the
                start and end line for the item.

                    Building a layout using the 12-column system

                <p>
                    To see how this layout method works in practice, we can create the same layout that we created with grid-template-areas,
                    this time using the 12-column grid system. I am starting with the same markup as used for the grid template areas
                    example.
